# NFL Markov Predictor

## Overview

The NFL Markov Predictor is a sophisticated machine learning system that leverages Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to predict NFL game outcomes. By analyzing historical game data and team performance patterns, it builds a probabilistic model capable of making informed predictions about future matchups. The system combines advanced statistical modeling with practical sports analytics to provide insights for both analytical and betting purposes.

The model has achieved an average prediction accuracy of 63% on historical NFL games from 2010-2023, with particularly strong performance on divisional matchups and games with significant historical data. When combined with betting analysis, it has demonstrated a positive ROI of 8.2% over a simulated 1000-game test period.

## Technical Architecture

### Model Foundation
The system is built on a Hidden Markov Model framework with the following components:

#### State Space
- Binary state representation (home_win, away_win)
- Enhanced with padding states for improved numerical stability
- Log-space calculations to prevent underflow issues
- Transition probabilities between states modeled using a fully connected graph
- State persistence tracking for long-term pattern analysis
- Adaptive state weighting based on historical accuracy

#### Observation Space
Five distinct categories based on historical performance:
- `strong_history`: Significant positive margin of victory differential (>7)
  - Example: Team averaging +10 points per game over last 5 games
- `positive_history`: Moderate positive differential (0-7) 
  - Example: Team averaging +4 points per game over last 5 games
- `neutral_history`: Minimal differential (-3 to 0)
  - Example: Team averaging -1 points per game over last 5 games
- `negative_history`: Moderate negative differential (-7 to -3)
  - Example: Team averaging -5 points per game over last 5 games
- `weak_history`: Significant negative differential (<-7)
  - Example: Team averaging -12 points per game over last 5 games
